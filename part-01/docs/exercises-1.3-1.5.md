# Exercises 1.3 - 1.5

## 1.3 Assignment
Modify the variable definitions of the `App` component as follows and also refactor the application so that it still works:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  const course = 'Half Stack application development'
  const part1 = {
    name: 'Fundamentals of React',
    exercises: 10
  }
  const part2 = {
    name: 'Using props to pass data',
    exercises: 7
  }
  const part3 = {
    name: 'State of a component',
    exercises: 14
  }

  return (
    <div>
      ...
    </div>
  )
}
```
